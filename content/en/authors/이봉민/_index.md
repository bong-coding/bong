I'm Bongmin Lee, a student at Chonbuk National University. I am preparing to become a backend developer.
He has been working with JavaScript, Python, and Node.js through various projects and has a strong passion for efficient code writing and problem solving. He is especially experienced in REST API design and database optimization, and aims to maximize team performance through collaboration.
For my REST API design project, I created a book management system. This project involves designing a RESTful API for a library or book management application. The main functions are adding, modifying, deleting, and viewing books, and we designed a REST API utilizing HTTP methods and URLs to implement them.
 I love learning new technologies and applying them in practice to create valuable results. I'm still a work in progress, but I hope you'll like it.
